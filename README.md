I am primarily active on Codeberg. While some of my projects may be mirrored here, others will stay on Codeberg exclusively.

Why am I doing this? [Just](https://devclass.com/2022/10/17/github-copilot-under-fire-as-dev-claims-it-emits-large-chunks-of-my-copyrighted-code/) [a](https://www.wired.com/story/github-commercial-ai-tool-built-open-source-code/) [few](https://medium.com/codex/github-copilot-what-developers-have-against-the-programming-assistant-ab082a1b5c84) [reasons](https://www.technollama.co.uk/is-githubs-copilot-potentially-infringing-copyright). Primarily [legal](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/) [concerns](https://medium.com/geekculture/githubs-ai-copilot-might-get-you-sued-if-you-use-it-c1cade1ea229).
